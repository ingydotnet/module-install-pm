=head1 NAME

inc::Module::Install - Module::Install loader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use inc::Module::Install;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module first checks whether the F<inc/.author> directory exists,
and removes the whole F<inc/> directory if it does, so the module author
always get a fresh F<inc> every time they run F<Makefile.PL>.  Next, it
unshifts C<inc> into C<@INC>, then loads B<Module::Install> from there.

Below is an explanation of the reason for using a I<loader module>:

The original implementation of B<CPAN::MakeMaker> introduces subtle
problems for distributions ending with C<CPAN> (e.g. B<CPAN.pm>,
B<WAIT::Format::CPAN>), because its placement in F<./CPAN/> duplicates
the real libraries that will get installed; also, the directory name
F<./CPAN/> may confuse users.

On the other hand, putting included, for-build-time-only libraries in
F<./inc/> is a normal practice, and there is little chance that a
CPAN distribution will be called C<Something::inc>, so it's much safer
to use.

Also, it allows for other helper modules like B<Module::AutoInstall>
to reside also in F<inc/>, and to make use of them.
