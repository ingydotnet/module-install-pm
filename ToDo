- Implement Module::Install::Compiled and Module::Install::Admin::Compiled
  to integrate the Module::Compiled "perl 6 to perl 5" functionality with
  Module::Install.
  Because this would add SIGNIFICANT dependencies (i.e. pugs!) this should
  almost certainly be distributed as a seperate distribution.

- Go over POD docs in detail.

- Test recursive Makefile directories

- Test Suite:
    - We need tests for everything
    
- Include:
    - Add support for include('Foo::Bar::*')	    # done
    - Make sure it works for Test::More		    # done

- Bundling:
    - Load distributions into inc/BUNDLE	    # not for 0.20
    - provide support to install/upgrade them on user machine

- Inline::C Support				    # done
    - Do we need to package build support?

- Distribution support
    - make upload (add cpan-upload to our recommends()?)
    - make distcheck:
        - verify metadata is current

- Dependencies on shared libraries (libxml/libxml.dll etc) and binary files
  so that debian/Win32/etc autopackaging applications can create the
  appropriate package-level dependencies there. # started

Note: EU::MM 6.06_03+ supports META.yml natively.  Maybe probe for that?
